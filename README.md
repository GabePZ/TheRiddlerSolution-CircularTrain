From Ben Tupper, ‘round and ‘round the railroad:

You find yourself in a train made up of some unknown number of connected train cars that join to form a circle. It’s the ouroboros of transportation. Don’t think too hard about its practical uses.

From the car you’re in, you can walk to a car on either side — and because the train is a circle, if you walk far enough eventually you’ll wind up back where you started. Each car has a single light that you can turn on and off. Each light in the train is initially set on or off at random.

What is the most efficient method for figuring out how many cars are in the train?

(Assume that you can’t mark or otherwise deface a train car, and that each car’s light is only visible from within that car. The doors automatically close behind you, too. There are only two actions you can take: turning on or off a light and walking between cars.)
